      A brief article about the life of Martin Luther King's achievements. 
    </h2>
    <ul> 
      <li><strong>1954</strong> - Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama</li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - He accepted the leadership of the first great Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States</li>
      <li><strong>1957</strong> - He was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. He was awarded the Spingarn Medal</li>
      <li><strong>1963</strong> - He was named Man of the Year by Time magazine</li>
       <li><strong>1964</strong> - He was the youngest man to receive the <strong>Nobel Price</strong>, at thirty five</li>
      <li><strong>1966</strong> - He received the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding and the Margaret Sanger Awards</li>
    <li><strong>1977</strong> - He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom</li>
      <li><strong>2012</strong> - He was included in the Grammy Hall of Fame</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p> In 1959 he went to India to meet with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and others and to discuss Gandhi's concepts of peaceful noncompliance. From this trip King became even more convinced that nonviolent resistance was the most effective way to fight against oppression and injustice.
    </p>
    <p> In 1963 King's campaign to end segregation at lunch counters gained national attention in Birmingham, Alabama, when police officers turned dogs and water hoses on demonstrators who had gathered there. King was jailed along with a large number of supporters. From the Birmingham jail he wrote his famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail" in which he spelled out his philosophy of nonviolence.
    </p>
     <p> Between 1957-1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous articles.
